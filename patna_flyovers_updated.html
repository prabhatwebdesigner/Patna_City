  <h3>History of Patna City</h3>
  <p>Patna’s legacy begins with its ancient name, Pataliputra, a city established in the 5th century BCE. As the capital of several mighty Indian empires including the Mauryas and Guptas, it was a hub of governance, science, and philosophy. Chanakya wrote the Arthashastra here, and Ashoka ruled his empire from this land. Buddhist and Jain traditions thrived, and foreign travelers like Megasthenes documented its glory. The ruins at Kumhrar, ancient stupas, and sites like Agam Kuan serve as windows into this past. Despite invasions and natural disasters, Patna endured, later becoming a Mughal administrative center and finally a British colonial seat. Today, the city bridges thousands of years of Indian civilization.</p>

  <h3>Urban Development</h3>
  <p>Patna is embracing a bold vision for urban renewal. Projects under the Smart City Mission include the Patna Metro, intelligent traffic systems, and sustainable drainage upgrades. The Ganga Riverfront project adds both functionality and aesthetics to city life. Modern flyovers and roads have significantly reduced traffic snarls, enhancing daily commuting. Urban greenery, solar lighting, and waste management initiatives reflect a growing environmental awareness. As high-rises replace old bazaars and digital governance takes root, the city balances tradition with innovation. Still, challenges like encroachment, pollution, and civic capacity demand sustained attention. Yet, the development pace signals Patna's ambition to become a model urban center in North India.</p>
